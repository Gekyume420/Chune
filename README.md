Next:

input code that omits a different beep tone when the data isn't recorded right

stops recording if nothing is being recorded/transcribed (not sure yet which is causing it to freeze) after a certain lengeth of time.

Sync the csv files somehow so that nick and jackson can see each other progress. Add a username variable (e.g. if user name == nick, track the voice commands into columns 'Nick Timestamp')
        There may be a better way to do this but that is what came to mind

system that logs time spent under the umbrella of a certain task priority (e.g. you say "starting task HIGH at 3pm" and later on say "stopping task HIGH at 6pm", the system should be able to keep track of how many points that is worth)

Add voice command ~"how many points do I have?" and the system shits out your running total
